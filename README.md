# Description

This project contains a 3D printed case that holds 4 potentiometers (or "knobs" as I will call them), an RGB LED addressable strip, a button, all controlled via Ardunio, used to light up a pane of etched glass. Each knob controls red, blue, green, and brightness respectively. Holding the button for 5 or more seconds will save the current color selected, pressing the button one from then on will set the LEDs to the saved color.

## Parts
Arduino Nano
RGB LED Strip
Potentiometers (x4 used total)
Button (only 1 used)

## Assembly
The middle, largest piece of the case is the main part. The knobs come out of the circular holes in the back, and the button goes in the very last circular hole. The partially circular hole in the middle bottom of the main piece is where the power cord for the Ardiuno comes out. 
The piece to the left (when looking top down) is an insert that lies inside of the main peice on top of the inner edges. The hole is for the wires of the LED strip to be connected to the Arduino. The LED strip lies on top of this piece.
The last, rightmost pieces are to restrict the light from the LEDs and hold the glass pane in place. The pegs holes fit onto the pegs from the main piece. The glass pane going through it will be resting on the LED strip itself.
